# HTTP Bin is a simple Request and Response service.
# It's a good resource for checking out how the client requests may react
# endpoint = "https://httpbin.org/status/200"
# endpoint = "https://httpbin.org/anything"



# A basic get request. This is no longer valid because the project has moved on.
# Keeping it here for a reminder of what happened in the tutorial.


# endpoint = "http://localhost:8000/api"

# get_response = requests.get(endpoint, params={"abc":123}, json={"query": "Hello world"})
